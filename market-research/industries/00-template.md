# [Industry Name] - AI-Powered Products & Internalization Market Research

작성일: YYYY-MM-DD

## Executive Summary

- (1) 이 산업에서 AI가 만드는 구조적 변화
- (2) 고객향 제품 vs 사내 내재화(내부 툴) 중심 축
- (3) In-house vs API 도입 패턴의 결론

## Market Size & Outlook

- Market sizing 1: (value, year -> forecast, CAGR, geo, definition) [^1]
- Market sizing 2 (optional): (range comparison and why definitions differ) [^2]

전망(필수):

- 12-24개월: (도입 가속 요인/제약)
- 3-5년: (기술/규제/비용 구조 변화)

## Where AI Creates Value (Value Chain)

- Customer-facing products: (recommendation, personalization, search, content generation, etc.)
- Internal tools: (ops automation, analytics, copilots, knowledge management)

## Implementation Patterns: In-House vs Big-Tech API

| Pattern | What It Looks Like | When It Wins | Risks/Costs | Evidence Signals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-house model | Self-host / fine-tuned / trained | Data/IP sensitivity, scale economics | Talent/infra, governance | Model cards, infra posts, hiring, papers |
| Big-tech API | Hosted LLM/image/video APIs | Fast launch, best frontier quality | Vendor lock-in, unit cost | Product docs, vendor case studies |
| Hybrid | Routing + staged migration | Balanced cost/risk | Complexity | Mixed evidence |

## Use Cases (Product + Internal)

### Customer-Facing Product Use Cases

- (Use case) -> (impact) -> (metrics)

### Internalization / Internal Tooling Use Cases

- (Use case) -> (workflow change) -> (ROI model)

## Company 사례 (Evidence-Based)

각 사례는 아래 중 하나로 분류:

- In-house model internalization
- Big-tech/third-party AI API usage
- Hybrid

## Risks, Constraints, and Governance

- Data privacy/security
- IP/copyright/licensing
- Regulatory compliance
- Model risk and brand trust

## Outlook & Strategic Recommendations

- Build vs buy vs hybrid decision heuristics
- Roadmap suggestions (pilot -> scale)
